December, 1050: 
Cameron: Hi Sharon
Sharon: Hi Cameron!
Mum sent me to tell you to do some chores around the farm instead of just relaxing all the time.
If you want though, we could sneak off and go play instead!
Cameron: I'll think on it - you always were a bad influence on me
Sharon: Hey - that's what sisters are for!
